# üß≠ THEPLAN.MD ‚Äî Genesis Bootstrap Spec (v2.Œ©) - ENTERPRISE EDITION

> ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: This prompt triggers the creation or reinforcement of `ThePlan.md`.
> If `ThePlan.md` does **not exist**, it must be generated and committed at the project root.
> If it **does exist**, this engine **validates and evolves** it against the current needs, ensuring it contains every core element of a fully agentic, governed build loop with enterprise-ready features.

The file `ThePlan.md` **must exist at the project root** and be recognized as the canonical app-specific master plan. It is evaluated alongside other `master docs` defined in `GLOBAL.md` to guide development, runtime logic, and agent triggers.
