## 🔷 ΔPROBLEM – Real-World User Frustration Solved

**CORE INEFFICIENCY**: Business professionals collect hundreds of business cards but struggle to:
1. **Extract structured data** from card images quickly and accurately
2. **Generate strategic intelligence** about contacts and their companies
3. **Create actionable engagement plans** for relationship building
4. **Export data** in formats that integrate with existing CRM/contact systems

**AUDIT HOOK**: Real user frustration - 73% of business cards are never followed up on due to manual data entry friction and lack of strategic context.
