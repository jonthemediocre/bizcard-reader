# vCard Format Improvements

## Issues Fixed

The original vCard format had several compliance issues:

### Before (Incorrect Format)

```

**Problems:**
- Missing `N` field (required for name structure)
- No field type specifications (WORK, HOME, etc.)
- No character escaping for special characters
- Improper address formatting
- Missing protocol for URLs
- Phone number formatting not standardized
- Empty fields still showing

```

## Key Improvements

1. **Proper Name Structure**: Added `N` field with Last;First;;; format
2. **Field Types**: Added TYPE=WORK for professional contacts
3. **Character Escaping**: Properly escape semicolons, commas, backslashes, and newlines
4. **Address Parsing**: Split address into components (street, city, state, zip, country)
5. **Phone Formatting**: Clean phone numbers for TEL field
6. **URL Protocol**: Ensure URLs have https:// protocol
7. **Conditional Fields**: Only include fields that have data
8. **Raw Text Note**: Include original text as NOTE field for reference

## Validation Features

- Built-in vCard validation function
- Checks for required fields (BEGIN, VERSION, FN, END)
- Validates line length compliance (75 char max recommended)
- Test function with sample data

## Usage

The improved vCard format is automatically used when exporting business card data:

```typescript
import { exportBusinessCard } from './services/businessCardExtractor';

const vcard = exportBusinessCard(businessCardData, 'vcard');
// Returns properly formatted vCard 3.0 compliant string
```

## Compatibility

This format is compatible with:
- Apple Contacts
- Google Contacts  
- Outlook
- Most CRM systems
- Mobile phone contact apps
- vCard readers and validators
