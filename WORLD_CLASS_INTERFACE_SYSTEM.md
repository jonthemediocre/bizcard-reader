  static getInstance(): ExpertAgent {
    if (!ExpertAgent.instance) {
      ExpertAgent.instance = new ExpertAgent();
    }
    return ExpertAgent.instance;
  }
  
  async analyzeSystem(): Promise<AnalysisResult> {
    // Comprehensive system analysis
  }
  
  async generateRecommendations(): Promise<Recommendations> {
    // AI-powered improvement suggestions
  }
}
```

### Orchestration Flow

```typescript
const runComprehensiveAnalysis = async () => {
  // Initialize all expert agents
  const agents = [uiAgent, uxAgent, backendAgent, testingAgent];
  
  // Run parallel analysis
  const results = await Promise.all(
    agents.map(agent => agent.analyze())
  );
  
  // Generate unified recommendations
  const prioritizedActions = generatePriorityActions(results);
  
  // Calculate composite scores
  const overallScore = calculateOverallScore(results);
  
  return { results, prioritizedActions, overallScore };
};
```
