## 🚨 **EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS**

### **Constitutional Crisis**
If L1 rules conflict or become impossible to enforce:
1. Immediate system freeze
2. Emergency CoE session
3. Temporary suspension of conflicting rules
4. Emergency amendment process
5. System restoration with new rules

### **Security Breach**
If security mandate is violated:
1. Immediate lockdown
2. Forensic analysis
3. Vulnerability patching
4. Security audit
5. Gradual system restoration
